            This is an experiment about individual decision making. If you pay attention to these instructions, you can earn a significant amount of money. If you have any questions, raise your hand and we will come to assist you. Your earnings will depend on the decisions you make during the experiment.<br><br>

            At the beginning of the experiment, you will receive an endowment of $20. At the end of the experiment, you may win a $12 Starbucks gift card. <br><br>
            
            This experiment will consist of several periods. Each period has two stages:<br><br>
            <div style="padding-left: 5vh">
                In stage 1, you will choose your probability of receiving ticket 1. Your stage 1 cost will depend on this probability.<br>
                In stage 2, you will choose your probability of receiving ticket 2. Your stage 2 cost will depend on this probability. <br><br>
                Your will win the $12 Starbucks gift card in this period if you receive both tickets in this period. Your total cost for this period is equal to the sum of your stage 1 cost and your stage 2 cost in this period. <br><br>
            </div>
            Your probability of winning the $12 Starbucks gift card will equal to your probability of getting ticket 1 multiplied by your probability of getting ticket 2. For example: <br><br>
            <div style="padding-left: 5vh">
                If you choose a 50% probability in stage 1 and an 80% probability in stage 2, then your probability of winning the $12 Starbucks gift card would be 40%. <br>
                If you choose a 60% probability in stage 1 and a 25% probability in stage 2, then your probability of winning the $12 Starbucks gift card would be 15%.<br><br> 
            </div>
            At the end of the experiment, one period will be randomly selected. Then you will find out whether you received ticket 1 and whether you received ticket 2 in this period. If you received both tickets, you will win the $12 Starbucks gift card. You will also receive $20 minus your total cost from the selected period in cash.<br><br>
